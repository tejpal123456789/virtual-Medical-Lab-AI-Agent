# Medical Research Agent Integration

## Overview

The Medical Research Assistant functionality from `bright_data.py` has been successfully integrated into the main `agent_decision.py` LangGraph flow as a new **MEDICAL_RESEARCH_AGENT** node.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Imports
- `asyncio`, `datetime` for async operations
- `ChatOpenAI` for the research LLM
- `MCPClient`, `LangChainAdapter` for Bright Data integration
- `create_react_agent` for the research agent

### 2. Medical Research Tools Setup
```python
async def setup_medical_research_tools()
def get_medical_research_tools()
```
- Initializes Bright Data MCP tools
- Handles async setup in sync context
- Caches tools for reuse

### 3. Medical Research Agent Implementation
```python
def run_medical_research_agent(state: AgentState) -> AgentState
```
- Follows the same pattern as other agents (RAG, Web Search, etc.)
- Uses Bright Data tools for comprehensive medical research
- Includes proper error handling and medical disclaimers
- Respects conversation context limits

### 4. LangGraph Integration
- Added `MEDICAL_RESEARCH_AGENT` node to the workflow
- Updated routing logic to include medical research agent
- Connected to validation check like other agents
- Enhanced decision system prompt for better routing

## How It Works

### Routing Decision
The system now intelligently routes queries to the appropriate agent:

- **RAG_AGENT**: Known medical knowledge from existing literature
- **WEB_SEARCH_PROCESSOR_AGENT**: Current medical news and developments  
- **MEDICAL_RESEARCH_AGENT**: Comprehensive research requiring deep analysis of medical literature, clinical trials, and authoritative sources

### Example Queries that Route to MEDICAL_RESEARCH_AGENT:
- "Research the latest clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease treatment"
- "Find recent medical literature on immunotherapy for cancer"
- "What are the latest treatment guidelines for Type 2 diabetes?"
- "Conduct a literature review on COVID-19 long term effects"
- "Research current clinical trials for depression treatment"

## Usage

### Through Agent Decision System (Recommended)
```python
from agents.agent_decision import process_query

# Simple usage
result = process_query("Research latest treatment for migraines")
print(result["output"].content)
```

### Environment Requirements
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN=your_bright_data_token
```

## Testing

### 1. Run Integration Test
```bash
python test_medical_research_integration.py
```

### 2. Run Usage Examples  
```bash
python example_medical_research_usage.py
```

## Features

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Medical Research**: Uses Bright Data tools to scrape medical sources
‚úÖ **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically routes research queries to the right agent
‚úÖ **Medical Safety**: Includes proper disclaimers and evidence-based focus
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if research tools fail
‚úÖ **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history for follow-up queries
‚úÖ **Professional Output**: Structured research summaries with source citations

## Key Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing LangGraph flow
2. **Automatic Routing**: Users don't need to specify which agent to use
3. **Consistent Interface**: Same `process_query()` function as other agents
4. **Medical Focus**: Specialized for medical research with appropriate safeguards
5. **Real-time Data**: Access to current medical literature and clinical trials

## Medical Research Capabilities

- üìö Literature Reviews from PubMed and medical journals
- üß™ Clinical Trial Data from ClinicalTrials.gov
- üè• Treatment Guidelines from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic
- üìä Drug Information and interactions
- üìà Epidemiological data and trends
- üéØ Evidence-based recommendations

The medical research agent is now fully integrated and ready to use within the multi-agent medical assistant system!
