## 🚀 Installation & Setup  <a name="installation-setup"></a>

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/souvikmajumder26/Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant.git  
cd Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant  
```

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment  
- If using conda:
```bash
conda create --name <environment-name> python=3.11
conda activate <environment-name>
```
- If using python venv:
```bash
python -m venv <environment-name>
source <environment-name>/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
<environment-name>\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> 1. ffmpeg is required for speech service to work.
> 2. Poppler and Tesseract OCR are essential for table extraction from PDFs using Unstructured.IO.

- To install poppler and tesseract OCR for Ubuntu/Debian/macOS:
```bash
# if on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils tesseract-ocr
```
```bash
# if on macOS
brew install poppler tesseract
```

- Install Poppler for Windows:
```bash
Download the latest poppler release for Windows from: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., 'C:\Program Files\poppler')
Add the bin directory to your PATH environment variable (e.g., 'C:\Program Files\poppler\bin')
```

- Install Tesseract OCR for Windows:
```bash
Download the Tesseract installer from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
Run the installer and complete the installation
By default, it installs to 'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR'
Make sure to add it to your PATH during installation or add it manually afterward
```

- Verify your installation:
```bash
Open a new command prompt (to ensure it has the updated PATH)
Run 'tesseract --version' to verify Tesseract is properly installed
Run 'pdfinfo -h' or 'pdftoppm -h' to verify Poppler is properly installed
```

- If using conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
- If using python venv:
```bash
winget install ffmpeg
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
- Might be required, might not be:
```bash
pip install unstructured[pdf]
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up API Keys  
- Create a `.env` file and add the following API keys:

> [!NOTE]  
> You may use any llm and embedding model of your choice...
> 1. If using Azure OpenAI, no modification required.
> 2. If using direct OpenAI, modify the llm and embedding model definitions in the 'config.py' and provide appropriate env variables.
> 3. If using local models, appropriate code changes might be required throughout the codebase especially in 'agents'.

> [!WARNING]  
> If all necessary env variables are not provided, errors will be thrown in console.

```bash
# LLM Configuration (Azure Open AI - gpt-4o used in development)
# If using any other LLM API key or local LLM, appropriate code modification is required
deployment_name = 
model_name = gpt-4o
azure_endpoint = 
openai_api_key = 
openai_api_version = 

# Embedding Model Configuration (Azure Open AI - text-embedding-ada-002 used in development)
# If using any other embedding model, appropriate code modification is required
embedding_deployment_name =
embedding_model_name = text-embedding-ada-002
embedding_azure_endpoint = 
embedding_openai_api_key = 
embedding_openai_api_version = 

# Speech API Key (Free credits available with new Eleven Labs Account)
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY = 

# Web Search API Key (Free credits available with new Tavily Account)
TAVILY_API_KEY = 

# Hugging Face Token - using reranker model "ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6"
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN = 

# (OPTIONAL) If using Qdrant server version, local does not require API key
QDRANT_URL = 
QDRANT_API_KEY = 
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Application  
- Run the following commands one after another in separate windows with same directorty and virtual environment. Keep both running simultanesouly.
```bash  
uvicorn api.fastapi_backend:app --reload
```

```bash
python app.py
```

### 6️⃣ Ingest additional data into the Vector DB
- Run any one of the following commands as required. First one to ingest one document at a time, second one to ingest multiple documents from a directory.
```bash
python ingest_rag_data.py --file ./data/raw/brain_tumors_ucni.pdf
```

```bash
python ingest_rag_data.py --dir ./data/raw
```

## 🧠 Usage  <a name="usage"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> 1. The first run can be jittery and may get errors - be patient and check the console for ongoing downloads and installations.
> 2. On the first run, many models will be downloaded - yolo for tesseract ocr, computer vision agent models, cross-encoder reranker model, etc.
> 3. Once they are completed, retry. Everything should work seamlessly since all of it is thoroughly tested.

- Upload medical images for **AI-based diagnosis**. Task specific Computer Vision model powered agents - upload images from 'sample_images' folder to try out.
- Ask medical queries to leverage **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** if information in memory or **web-search** to retrieve latest information.  
- Use **voice-based** interaction (speech-to-text and text-to-speech).  
- Review AI-generated insights with **human-in-the-loop verification**.
