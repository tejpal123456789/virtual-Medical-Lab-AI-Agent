## What causes brain tumors?

Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have:

- · cancer elsewhere in the body
- · prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals
- · inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis

Figure 2. Brain tumor symptoms are related to the functional areas of the brain, giving doctors clues as to the tumor location.

It shows different regions including the frontal lobe, motor strip, sensory strip, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and brainstem. Each region is color-coded for clarity. The diagram is attributed to the Mayfield Clinic.

- · Memory loss
- · Paralysis on one side of the body
- · Reduced mental abilities
- · Vision loss


## Parietal lobe tumors may cause:
