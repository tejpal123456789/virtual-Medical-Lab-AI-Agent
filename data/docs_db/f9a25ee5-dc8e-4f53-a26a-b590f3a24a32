## How is a diagnosis made?

First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete physical examination. In addition to checking your general health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial nerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and facial movement), muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may include:

- 路 Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an audiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors near the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma).
- 路 An endocrine evaluation measures hormone levels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal levels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing's Disease).
- 路 A visual field acuity test is performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and missing areas in your field of view.
- 路 A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood.

The left scan is labeled "Benign" and shows a large, well-defined area that appears lighter in color, indicating a non-cancerous mass. The right scan is labeled "Malignant" and depicts a more irregular and darker area, suggesting the presence of a tumor with potential invasive characteristics. Both images are in grayscale and highlight differences in tissue composition related to the diagnosis of brain conditions.
