## Glossary

anaplastic: when cells divide rapidly and bear little or no resemblance to normal cells in appearance or function.

astrocytoma: a tumor arising in the supportive cells (astrocytes) of the brain or spinal cord; most often in the cerebrum.

benign : does not invade nearby tissues or spread; noncancerous.

biopsy : a sample of tissue cells for examination under a microscope to determine the existence or cause of a disease.

brachytherapy : a type of radiation therapy where capsules containing radioactive substances are surgically implanted into the tumor to deliver radiation; also called internal radiotherapy. cancer : generic term for more than 100 different diseases caused by uncontrolled, abnormal growth of cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy normal tissue, and can travel through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to reach other parts of the body. chemotherapy : treatment with toxic chemicals

(e.g., anticancer drugs).

chondrosarcoma: a rare, malignant bone tumor arising from primitive notochord cells and composed of cartilage.

chordoma : a rare, bone tumor arising from primitive notochord cells; usually occurs at the base of the spine (sacrum) or at the skull base (clivus).

craniopharyngioma : a benign tumor arising from cells located near the pituitary stalk.

differentiation : refers to how developed cancer cells are in a tumor. Well-differentiated tumor cells resemble normal cells and tend to grow and spread at a slower rate than undifferentiated, which lack the structure and function of normal cells and grow uncontrollably.

edema : tissue swelling caused by the accumulation of fluid.

ependymoma : a tumor arising from the ependyma cells lining the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord.

epidermoid : a benign, congenital tumor arising from ectodermal cells; also called pearly tumor. glioma : any tumor arising from glial tissue of the brain, which provides energy, nutrients, and other support for nerve cells in the brain.

hydrocephalus : an abnormal build-up of cerebrospinal fluid usually caused by a blockage of

the ventricular system of the brain; also called 'water on the brain.'

or restore the immune system's ability to fight infection and disease. immunotherapy : treatment designed to improve skull. Normal ICP is 20 mm HG. intracranial pressure (ICP) : pressure within the

tissue, such as tumor, blood, malformation, infection, or scar tissue. lesion : a general term that refers to any change in may metastasize to the brain from lymphoma tumor elsewhere in the body. lymphoma: a rare tumor arising from lymph cells;

growth and ability to spread to other areas. malignant : having the properties of invasive of a tumor, the blockage of fluid, and/or excess accumulation of fluid within the skull. mass effect : damage to the brain due to the bulk

nerve cells; most often in the cerebellum. medulloblastoma : a tumor arising from primitive the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. meningioma: a tumor arising from the meninges,

its original source through the blood or lymph systems. metastasis : the spreading of malignant cells. metastatic : cancerous tumor that has spread from support cells (oligodendroglia) that produce myelin, the fatty covering around nerve cells. oligodendroglioma : a tumor arising from the

the pituitary gland; tumor may be hormonesecreting (prolactin, adrenocorticotropic, growth hormone) or not. pituitary adenoma : a tumor arising from cells in used to treat disease. radiation : high-energy rays or particle streams

arising from Schwann cells that produce myelin. brain structures by the use of 3-dimensional oordinates. schwannoma (also called neuroma): a tumor stereotactic : a precise method for locating deep c from uncontrolled multiplication of cells and serving no physiological function; can be benign or malignant. tumor : an abnormal growth of tissue resulting
