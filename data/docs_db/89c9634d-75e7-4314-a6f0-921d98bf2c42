## Surgery

Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the

In the upper left corner, there are three smaller diagrams showing a series of tubes, likely illustrating a procedure or technique related to the main image. A hand is depicted holding a medical instrument, which is positioned towards the affected area in the brain. The overall focus is on a medical procedure, possibly related to diagnosis or treatment.

skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells.

Improvements in techniques, particularly imageguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon's ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor's borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room.
