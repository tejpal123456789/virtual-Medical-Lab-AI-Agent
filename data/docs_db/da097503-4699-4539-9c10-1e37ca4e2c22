## What causes brain tumors?

Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have:

- · cancer elsewhere in the body
- · prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals
- · inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis
