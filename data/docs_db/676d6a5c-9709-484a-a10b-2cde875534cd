## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

picture_counter_6 The image displays an axial MRI slice of the brain, labeled as "Slice no. 18." It features a central area highlighted with multiple concentric contours in different colors, indicating regions of interest or radiation dose levels. The contours are marked with crosshairs, suggesting specific points of measurement. In the lower right corner, a color-coded scale indicates radiation dose levels of 9.00 Gy, 16.00 Gy, and 32.00 Gy, with a percentage representation of 100.0% at 20.00 Gy. A small anatomical diagram is present in the lower left corner, depicting a stylized representation of the brain.
